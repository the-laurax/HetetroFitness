My first attempt at making bots and working with the Discord API - a simple joke bot (designed for House Hetetro) to help keep a server alive. Sends the FitnessGram Pacer Test script if no messages are sent in a channel within hourly intervals. Channel IDs have to be replaced if used in different servers - as of now, client channels are hard-coded into the bot. Command to start channel watch for 7 hours is "?watch"
