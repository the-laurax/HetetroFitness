# HetetroFitness-
A simple joke bot to help keep a Discord server alive. Sends the FitnessGram Pacer Test message if no messages are sent in a channel within hourly intervals. Channel IDs have to be replaced - as of now, channels are hard-coded into the bot. Command to start channel watch for 10 hours is "?watch". Inspired by House Hetetro, bonus features added for said house.
