# HetetroFitness-
A simple joke bot to help keep a Discord server alive. Sends the FitnessGram Pacer Test script if no messages are sent in a certain channel within hourly intervals. Channel IDs have to be replaced - as of now, client channels are hard-coded into the bot. Command to start channel watch for 7 hours is "?watch". Inspired by House Hetetro; bonus features added. Images from The Lorax, The Bee Movie, and Shrek are not mine lol
