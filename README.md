# HetetroFitness-
A simple Discord bot to help keep a server running. Sends the FitnessGram Pacer Test message if no messages are sent in a channel within hourly intervals. Channel IDs have to be replaced - as of now, channels are hard-coded into the bot. Command to start channel watch for 6 hours is "?watch".
